# QA Automation Portfolio

This repository showcases various QA automation tools and frameworks, including Selenium, Playwright, Rest Assured, JMeter, and AI-based testing tools.

## Skills Demonstrated
- UI Automation (Selenium, Playwright)
- API Testing (Rest Assured)
- Performance Testing (JMeter)
- AI-based Testing (Testim, Applitools)
- Security Testing (ZAP, Burp Suite)
- Defect Prediction using Machine Learning

## Projects
1. **Selenium Java**: Parallel UI tests with TestNG.
2. **Playwright Python**: Async tests with visual regression.
3. **Rest Assured**: API functional testing.
4. **Performance Testing**: JMeter load tests for APIs.
5. **AI Testing**: Testim/Applitools for AI-driven validation.
6. **Security Testing**: ZAP/Burp scans for vulnerabilities.
7. **Defect Prediction**: ML model for bug forecasting.

## Setup Guide
Each folder contains a `README.md` file with specific setup and execution instructions.
